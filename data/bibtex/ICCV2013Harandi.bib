 Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning
 suggest that a wide range of problems can be addressed
 more appropriately by considering non-Euclidean geometry.
 In this paper we explore sparse dictionary learning
 over the space of linear subspaces, which form Riemannian
 structures known as Grassmann manifolds. To this end, we
 propose to embed Grassmann manifolds into the space of
 symmetric matrices by an isometric mapping, which enables
 us to devise a closed-form solution for updating a
 Grassmann dictionary, atom by atom. Furthermore, to handle
 non-linearity in data, we propose a kernelised version
 of the dictionary learning algorithm.}
