    abstract = {In image recognition with the bag-of-features model, a small-sized visual
    codebook is usually preferred to obtain a low- dimensional histogram
    representation and high computational efficiency. Such a visual codebook
    has to be discriminative enough to achieve excellent recognition
    performance. To create a compact and discriminative codebook, in this paper
    we propose to merge the visual words in a large-sized initial codebook by
    maximally preserving class separability. We first show that this results in
    a difficult optimization problem. To deal with this situation, we devise a
    suboptimal but very efficient hierarchical word-merging algorithm, which
    optimally merges two words at each level of the hierarchy. By exploiting
    the characteristics of the class separability measure and designing a novel
    indexing structure, the proposed algorithm can hierarchically merge 10,000
    visual words down to two words in merely 90 seconds. Also, to show the
    properties of the proposed algorithm and reveal its advantages, we conduct
    detailed theoretical analysis to compare it with another hierarchical
    word-merging algorithm that maximally preserves mutual information,
obtaining interesting findings. Experimental studies are conducted to verify
    the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on multiple benchmark data
    sets. As shown, it can efficiently produce more compact and discriminative
    codebooks than the state-of-the-art hierarchical word- merging algorithms,
especially when the size of the codebook is significantly reduced.
