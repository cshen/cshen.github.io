    abstract={
            Text in an image provides vital information for interpreting its
            contents, and text in a scene can aide with a variety of tasks from
            navigation, to obstacle avoidance, and odometry. Despite its value,
            however, identifying general text in images remains a challenging
            research problem. Motivated by the need to consider the widely
            varying forms of natural text, we propose a bottom-up approach to
            the problem which reflects the 'characterness' of an image
            region.  In this sense our approach mirrors the move from saliency
            detection methods to measures of `objectness'. In order to measure
            the characterness we develop three novel cues that are tailored for
            character detection, and a Bayesian method for their integration.
            Because text is made up of sets of characters, we then design a
            Markov random field (MRF) model so as to exploit the inherent
            dependencies between characters.  We experimentally demonstrate the
            effectiveness of our characterness cues as well as the advantage of
            Bayesian multi-cue integration. The proposed text detector
            outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a few benchmark scene text
            detection datasets. We also show that our measurement of
            'characterness' is superior than state-of-the-art saliency
            detection models when applied to the same task.
