    abstract={
Boosting is a method for learning a single accurate predictor by linearly
    combining a set of less accurate weak learners. Recently, structured
    learning has found many applications in computer vision. Thus far it has
    not been clear how one can train a boosting model that is directly
    optimized for predicting multivariate or structured outputs. To bridge this
    gap, inspired by structured support vector machines (SSVM), here we propose
    a boosting algorithm for structured output prediction, which we refer to as
    StructBoost. StructBoost supports nonlinear structured learning by
    combining a set of weak structured learners. As SSVM generalizes SVM, our
    StructBoost generalizes standard boosting approaches such as AdaBoost, or
    LPBoost to structured learning. The resulting optimization problem of
    StructBoost is more challenging than SSVM in the sense that it may involve
    exponentially many variables and constraints. In contrast, for SSVM one
    usually has an exponential number of constraints and a cutting-plane method
    is used. In order to efficiently solve StructBoost, we formulate an
    equivalent 1-slack formulation and solve it using a combination of cutting
    planes and column generation. We show the versatility and usefulness of
    StructBoost on a range of problems such as optimizing the tree loss for
    hierarchical multi-class classification, optimizing the Pascal overlap
    criterion for robust visual tracking and learning conditional random field
    parameters for image segmentation.
