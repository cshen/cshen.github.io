    abstract={We propose a fast, accurate matching method for estimating dense pixel correspondences across scenes.
              It is a challenging problem to estimate dense pixel correspondences between images depicting different scenes
              or instances of the same object category.
              While most such matching methods rely on hand-crafted features such as SIFT,
              we learn features from a large amount of unlabeled image patches using unsupervised learning.
              Pixel-layer features are obtained by encoding over the dictionary,
              followed by spatial pooling to obtain patch-layer features.
              The learned features are then seamlessly embedded into a multi-layer match-ing framework.
              We experimentally demonstrate that the learned features,
              together with our matching model, outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as the SIFT flow,
              coherency sensitive hashing and the recent deformable spatial pyramid matching methods both in terms of accuracy
              and computation efficiency. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of a few different dictionary learning and feature
              encoding methods in the proposed pixel correspondences estimation framework,
              and analyse the impact of dictionary learning and feature encoding with respect to the final matching performance.

            Supervised hashing aims to map the original features to compact
                binary codes that are able to preserve label based similarity
                in the Hamming space. Non-linear hash functions have
                demonstrated the advantage over linear ones due to their
                powerful generalization capability. In the literature, kernel
                functions are typically used to achieve non-linearity in
                hashing, which achieve encouraging retrieval perfor- mance at
                the price of slow evaluation and training time. Here we propose
                to use boosted decision trees for achieving non-linearity in
                hashing, which are fast to train and evaluate, hence more
                suitable for hashing with high dimensional data. In our
                approach, we first propose sub-modular formulations for the
                hashing binary code inference problem and an efficient GraphCut
                based block search method for solving large-scale inference.
                Then we learn hash func- tions by training boosted decision
                trees to fit the binary codes. Experiments demonstrate that our
                proposed method significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art
                methods in retrieval precision and training time. Especially
                for high- dimensional data, our method is orders of magnitude
                faster than many methods in terms of training time.

    Minimization of the $L_\infty$ norm, which can be viewed as approximately
    solving the non-convex least median estimation problem, is a powerful
    method for outlier removal and hence robust regression. However, current
    techniques for solving the problem at the heart of $L_\infty$  norm minimization are
    slow, and therefore cannot scale to large problems. A new method for the
    minimization of the $L_\infty$ norm is presented here, which provides a speedup of
    multiple orders of magnitude for data with high dimension. This method,
    termed Fast $L_\infty$  Minimization, allows robust regression to be applied to a class
    of problems which were previously inaccessible. It is shown how the $L_\infty$ norm
    minimization problem can be broken up into smaller sub-problems, which can
    then be solved extremely efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the
    radical reduction in computation time, along with robustness against large
    numbers of outliers in a few model-fitting problems.

Boosting is a method for learning a single accurate predictor by linearly
    combining a set of less accurate weak learners. Recently, structured
    learning has found many applications in computer vision. Thus far it has
    not been clear how one can train a boosting model that is directly
    optimized for predicting multivariate or structured outputs. To bridge this
    gap, inspired by structured support vector machines (SSVM), here we propose
    a boosting algorithm for structured output prediction, which we refer to as
    StructBoost. StructBoost supports nonlinear structured learning by
    combining a set of weak structured learners. As SSVM generalizes SVM, our
    StructBoost generalizes standard boosting approaches such as AdaBoost, or
    LPBoost to structured learning. The resulting optimization problem of
    StructBoost is more challenging than SSVM in the sense that it may involve
    exponentially many variables and constraints. In contrast, for SSVM one
    usually has an exponential number of constraints and a cutting-plane method
    is used. In order to efficiently solve StructBoost, we formulate an
    equivalent 1-slack formulation and solve it using a combination of cutting
    planes and column generation. We show the versatility and usefulness of
    StructBoost on a range of problems such as optimizing the tree loss for
    hierarchical multi-class classification, optimizing the Pascal overlap
    criterion for robust visual tracking and learning conditional random field
    parameters for image segmentation.

         To achieve effective and efficient detection of Alzheimer's disease
             (AD), many machine learning methods have been introduced into this
             realm. However, the general case of limited training samples, as
             well as different feature representations typically makes this
             problem challenging. In this work, we propose a novel multiple
             kernel learning framework to combine multi-modal features for AD
             classification, which is scalable and easy to implement. Contrary
             to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual space, we look
             at the optimization from a new perspective. By conducting Fourier
             transform on the Gaussian kernel, we explicitly compute the
             mapping function, which leads to a more straightforward solution
             of the problem in the primal space. Furthermore, we impose the
             mixed $L_{21}$ norm constraint on the kernel weights, known as the
             group lasso regularization, to enforce group sparsity among
             different feature modalities. This actually acts as a role of
             feature modality selection, while at the same time exploiting
             complementary information among different kernels. Therefore it is
             able to extract the most discriminative features for
             classification. Experiments on the ADNI data set demonstrate the
             effectiveness of the proposed method.

            Text in an image provides vital information for interpreting its
            contents, and text in a scene can aide with a variety of tasks from
            navigation, to obstacle avoidance, and odometry. Despite its value,
            however, identifying general text in images remains a challenging
            research problem. Motivated by the need to consider the widely
            varying forms of natural text, we propose a bottom-up approach to
            the problem which reflects the 'characterness' of an image
            region.  In this sense our approach mirrors the move from saliency
            detection methods to measures of `objectness'. In order to measure
            the characterness we develop three novel cues that are tailored for
            character detection, and a Bayesian method for their integration.
            Because text is made up of sets of characters, we then design a
            Markov random field (MRF) model so as to exploit the inherent
            dependencies between characters.  We experimentally demonstrate the
            effectiveness of our characterness cues as well as the advantage of
            Bayesian multi-cue integration. The proposed text detector
            outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a few benchmark scene text
            detection datasets. We also show that our measurement of
            'characterness' is superior than state-of-the-art saliency
            detection models when applied to the same task.

            Most existing approaches to hashing apply a single form of
            hash function, and an optimization process which is typically deeply
            coupled to this specific form. This tight coupling restricts the
            flexibility of the method to respond to the data, and can result in
            complex optimization problems that are difficult to solve. Here we
            propose a flexible yet simple framework that is able to accommodate
            different types of loss functions and hash functions. This
            framework allows a number of existing approaches to hashing to be
            placed in context, and simplifies the development of new
            problem-specific hashing methods. Our framework decomposes hashing
            learning problem into two steps: hash bit learning and hash
            function learning based on the learned bits. The first step can
            typically be formulated as binary quadratic problems, and the
            second step can be accomplished by training standard binary
            classifiers. Both problems have been extensively studied in the
            literature.

 within a prescribed false-positive range. In this situation
 the performance of a detector should be assessed on the basis
 of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather
 than over the full curve, as the performance outside the
 range is irrelevant. This measure is labelled as the partial
 area under the ROC curve (pAUC). Effective cascade-based
 classification, for example, depends on training node classifiers
 that achieve the maximal detection rate at a moderate
 false positive rate, e.g., around 40% to 50%. We propose
 a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal
 detection rate at a user-defined range of false positive
 rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured
 learning. By optimizing for different ranges of false
 positive rates, the proposed method can be used to train
 either a single strong classifier or a node classifier forming
 part of a cascade classifier. Experimental results on both
 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness
 of our approach, and we show that it is possible
 to train state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors using the
 proposed structured ensemble learning method.},

    Distance metric learning is of fundamental interest in machine learning
        because the distance metric employed can significantly affect the
        performance of many learning methods. Quadratic Mahalanobis metric
        learning is a popular approach to the problem, but typically requires
        solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which is
        computationally expensive. Standard interior-point SDP solvers
        typically have a complexity of O(D^6.5) (with D the dimension of input
                data), and can thus only practically solve problems exhibiting
        less than a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is
        D(D+1)/2, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can
        practically be solved of around a few hundred dimensions. The
        complexity of the popular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning
        approach thus limits the size of problem to which metric learning can
        be applied. Here we propose a significantly more efficient approach to
        the metric learning problem based on the Lagrange dual formulation of
        the problem. The proposed formulation is much simpler to implement, and
        therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric learning problems to be
        solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is O(D^3), which is
        significantly lower than that of the SDP approach. Experiments on a
        variety of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an
        accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art, but is applicable to
        significantly larger problems. We also show that the proposed method
        can be applied to solve more general Frobenius-norm regularized SDP
        problems approximately.

    abstract = {In image recognition with the bag-of-features model, a small-sized visual
    codebook is usually preferred to obtain a low- dimensional histogram
    representation and high computational efficiency. Such a visual codebook
    has to be discriminative enough to achieve excellent recognition
    performance. To create a compact and discriminative codebook, in this paper
    we propose to merge the visual words in a large-sized initial codebook by
    maximally preserving class separability. We first show that this results in
    a difficult optimization problem. To deal with this situation, we devise a
    suboptimal but very efficient hierarchical word-merging algorithm, which
    optimally merges two words at each level of the hierarchy. By exploiting
    the characteristics of the class separability measure and designing a novel
    indexing structure, the proposed algorithm can hierarchically merge 10,000
    visual words down to two words in merely 90 seconds. Also, to show the
    properties of the proposed algorithm and reveal its advantages, we conduct
    detailed theoretical analysis to compare it with another hierarchical
    word-merging algorithm that maximally preserves mutual information,
obtaining interesting findings. Experimental studies are conducted to verify
    the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on multiple benchmark data
    sets. As shown, it can efficiently produce more compact and discriminative
    codebooks than the state-of-the-art hierarchical word- merging algorithms,
especially when the size of the codebook is significantly reduced.

    It has been shown that the Universum data, which do not belong to either
      class of the classification problem of interest, may contain useful prior
      domain knowledge for training a classifier. In this work, we
      design a novel boosting algorithm that takes advantage of the available
      Universum data, hence the name UBoost. UBoost is a boosting
      implementation of Vapnik’s alternative capacity concept to the large
      margin approach. In addition to the standard regularization term, UBoost
      also controls the learned model’s capacity by maximizing the number of
      observed contradictions. Our experiments demonstrate that UBoost can
      deliver improved classification accuracy over standard boosting
      algorithms that use labeled data alone.
